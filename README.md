# Exact Solution Algorithms for the Chordless Cycle Problem
This page contains problem instances for the maximum induced cycle problem used in the paper "Exact Solution Algorithms for the Chordless Cycle Problem", to be published on the INFORMS Journal on Computing, as well as a spreadsheet with results obtained by the main algorithms in the paper.

## Instance file format
The first line gives two integers, n and m, the numbers of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.
Each of the following m lines gives the two endpoints of an edge (zero based indexing).
